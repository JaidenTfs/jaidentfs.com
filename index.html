            <p>"Hey, It's me JaidenTfs, a composer with ambitious dreams in the music industry. I want to produce scores for games, film, and other interactive media."</p>
            <p>Jaiden is a 17-year-old who loves everything music. <br> If you would like to contact him, the best way is through email or Instagram dms.</p>
	    <p>One of my recent experiences was a 48-hour game jam, where I composed the music for a game called "Little Guy, Big Sword." The game follows a character thrown into an underground arena, surviving waves of enemies before facing a final boss—a winged creature with explosive attacks. The music was designed to heighten the action, quiet moments, and the emotional highs and lows of victory and defeat.</p>
	     <p>I’ve also contributed to the ARG project "Dear Clarent," working with Imbernet Entertainment, an indie studio focused on creating realistic fiction inspired by historical events and figures. In this project, I worked with the founder and another composer to create the "Dear Clarent Songbook," a collection of songs from the game's world thatt tell emotional stories through music. Along with composing original tracks, I’ve helped plan features for the project.</p>
	     <h2>△Under construction△</h2>
	     <p>Surprisingly, coding your own website from scratch is pretty difficult and takes a decent amount of time. Come back every so often to see the new features and information added, as I plan to consistently make the website experience as smooth and professional as possible!</p>
